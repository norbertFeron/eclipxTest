App developed for Eclipx as a challenge for a job interview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You need to copy src/firebaseConfig.example.js to src/firebaseConfig.js and replace with your key, you also need to provide a google js api key in src/Components/googleMaps.js.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the react app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
